# USGS_LIDAR-_AgriTech_

At AgriTech, we are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research 
on new agricultural products being tested on farms.How much maize a field produces is very spatially variable?

One important ingredient to understanding water flow in a field is by measuring the elevation of the field at many points. The ['USGS recently released high 
resolution elevation data'] as a lidar point cloud called USGS 3DEP in a public dataset on Amazon. 
This dataset is essential to build models of water flow and predict plant health and maize harvest.
